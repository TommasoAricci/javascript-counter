# READY TO COUN'TILL YOU CAN?

### This is the title of my new Javascript project, a beautiful counter!

## About the project

After weeks stydying the basics of Javascript I wanted to challenge myself creating a simple counter. As I started the project I got passionate about Js language, figuring out all the issues and finding different ways to write the code. That's why I haven't created just a simple counter but I decided to add some more functions, in order to have something more interactive. 

## How it works
